\section{Abstract}\label{abstract}}

The present study investigates bilinguals' first exposure to an L3 that
they do not yet know in order to inform debates in L3 phonological
acquisition. Specifically, participants who speak L1 Mexican Spanish and
L2 English were given French words to repeat in order to examine whether
the phonology of their first language or their second language plays a
greater role in the starting point of L3 phonological acquisition.
Previous studies have shown that, in the case of voice-onset time (VOT),
L3 learners are primarily influenced by the L2 (Wrembel, 2010; Llama et
al., 2010), or by hybrid values between the L1 and the L2 (Wrembel,
2011; Llama \& Cardoso, 2018). One potential reason for the variation in
findings may stem from small sample sizes in L3 research. Small sample
size is associated with an increased risk of committing type 1 or type 2
errors (Brysbaert, 2020), and it is possible that the variation in the
effects found in the literature to date could be explained by sampling
error, in addition to varied methodology. To address these potential
issues, the present study employs a higher sample size (n = 75) of
absolute beginners and uses tests of equivalence (Lakens, 2017) in order
to determine whether a group trend of the use L1 and/or L2 phonology
exists in the pronunciation of L3 words at the first exposure.

A total of 75 participants completed a shadowing task in which they
repeated 26 stop-initial words in all three places of articulation, and
elicited production tasks in Spanish and English. A comparison group of
50 Mexican Spanish monolinguals also completed the shadowing task. All
stimuli were either one or two syllable words and were stressed on the
first syllable. Words were presented in isolation and in a random order
in language specific blocks. Participants also completed a language
background questionnaire and the LexTALE lexical decision task (Lemhöfer
\& Broersma, 2011) in English as measure of proficiency.

The data were analyzed using within-subjects tests of equivalence
(Lakens, 2017) and paired t-tests. The results revealed that L3 relative
VOT was practically equivalent to L2 VOT, and that L1 and L2 VOT were
distinct. Additionally, a Bayesian multilevel regression model was used
to analyze the data where relative VOT (Stölten et al., 2015) was
modeled as a function of the fixed effect language. The results of the
Bayesian regression model matched those of the frequentist tests and
provided additional evidence that L3 words are produced using L2-like
VOT at first exposure. The present study underscores the need for tests
of equivalence and higher sample sizes in L3 research. Additionally, the
results presented here suggest that L2 status effects may overcome the
effects of typology, at least within the domain of phonology and at
first exposure to an L3.
