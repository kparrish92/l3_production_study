# Are L2 acquisition and L3 acquisition the same?

---

# Introduction

.big[
- If L2 and L3 learning are the same, there should be **no difference between monolingual and bilingual participants** when learning a new language.
]

--

.big[
- Specifically, the **L2 should not impact L3 learning**. 
]

--

.big[
- The present study investigates this assertion by examining the production of Voice Onset Time in **bilinguals** and **monolinguals** in a language they do not yet know.
]

# Introduction

- L3 research suggests that L3 and L2 acquisition are distinct processes and investigates what factors impact how the L1 and/or L2 impact the acquisition of a new language.

--

.pull-left[
.full-width[
.content-box-red[
- Some accounts suggest that **only one source language** plays a primary role in L3A. 
 - **Typological Primacy Model** Closer psycho-typological language holistically influences the L3 (Rothman, 2015).
 - **The L2 Status Factor** The L2 has a special status and blocks access to the L1 (Bardel & Falk, 2007).
]]]

--

.pull-right[
.full-width[
.content-box-red[ 
- Other accounts suggest that **both the L1 and L2** influence the L3.
 - **The Cumulative Enhancement Model** L3 learning is a cumulative process (Flynn et al., 2004).
 - **The Linguistic Proximity Model/Scalpel Model** L3 learning occurs on a structure-by-structure basis and is influenced by underlying structural similarity between either L1 or L2 and L3 (Westergaard et al. 2017; Slabakova, 2017).

This model was run to determine how language predicted VOT.

`relative vot ~ language*group + (1 | word) + (1 | participant)`

- Outcome was *relative VOT* (vot/total word duration).

- Fixed effect predictors: *Language* (Spanish, English, French), *group* (monolingual or bilingual) and their interaction.

- Random intercepts: *Word* and *participant*.

# Interim Discussion

.large[
.pull-left[
- During hand-correction, I noticed many participants produced **target-like** VOT in L3 French, while others **produced long-lag stops**.

- These two trends suggest that the overall observed group trends are the culmination of two specific trends, rather than most participants producing intermediate values.

- As a result, the full bilingual dataset was subset post-hoc into **L1-influence** and **L2-influence** subsets.

.content-box-red[
**Is L3A another case of L2A?**

- Monolinguals and bilinguals were different.  

- If participants are trilinguals performing a task in a new or learned language, one should keep in mind that the CLI from both previously learned languages might be a possible influence. 

**Does the L1 or L2 impact the L3?**

- Both seem to at the group level.

- Individual trends exist in the data.

**Conclusion and Future directions**

- Overall, L3 French fell between L1 Spanish and L2 English relative VOT values.

- There was variation in the results

- My research contributes to L3A in that it shows that individual differences may play an important role is predicting CLI

- Future and ongoing projects aim to explore which factors might be associated with this variation
